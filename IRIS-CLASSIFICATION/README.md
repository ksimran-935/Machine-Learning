# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification App

This is a simple Machine Learning project that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** â€” based on sepal and petal measurements.  
The project is powered by a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier and deployed using **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Given 4 features of an Iris flower:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Predict the **species** of the flower using a trained ML model.

## ðŸ§  Learnings

- Built a supervised ML model (KNN) to classify Iris species .
- Visualized feature relationships using `seaborn.pairplot` for intuitive EDA.
- Deployed the trained model as an interactive web app using Streamlit.
